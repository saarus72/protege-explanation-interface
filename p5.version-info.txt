The Live Ontologies Project team is pleased to announce 
        the Protege Justification Explanation 0.0.1 release!

This is a plug-in that adds justification-based explanation facilities 
to the Protege Desktop ontology editor. It registers as an extension to the Protege 
explanation services and defines an extension point using which justifications can 
be provided by other Protege plug-ins. The main functionality of this plug-in 
is displaying a list of these justifications in the user interface.
